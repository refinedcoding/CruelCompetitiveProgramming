low bit operation

Suppose that $n$​ is a nonnegative integer, then $n & (-n)$​ outputs the lowest bit of $n$​.

proof: Recall that $-n - 1$​ is the two's complement of n, and suppose that the lowest bit of n is its $k$​ th bit. Then the 0th to the k - 1th bit of - n - 1 + 1 are all 0, and the bits beyond the kth bit remains opposite to $n$. ​ 

```c++
const MAX_N = 1 << 20;
int H[MAX_N + 1];
for(int i =0 ; i < 20; i++) H[1 << i]  = i;
while(cin << n){
    while(n > 0){
        cout << H[n & -n] << ' ';
        n -= n & -n;
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

Here we use a trick to calculate which bit we are currently looking at, instead of using $log_{2}$ to carry out the calculation directly because $log_2$​ is slow.



We can do better than this using the fact that $\forall k  \in [0, 35], 2^{k} % 37$ is distinct from each other, and ranges from 1 to 36.



```c++
int H[37]
for(int i = 0; i < 36; i++) H[(1ll << i) % 37] = i;
while(cin << n){
	while(n > 0){
		cout <<H[(n & -n) % 37] << ' ';
		n -= n & -n;
	}
}
```
